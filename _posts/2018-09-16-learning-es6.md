After refreshing the basics of JavaScript, I decided to learn ES6 which is a newer version of JavaScript released in 2015. 
ES6 is the sixth major release of the ECMAScript language specification that adds significant new syntax for writing 
complex applications like classes, modules and arrow functions.

Most modern browsers have implemented these features, thus we don't need a transpiler like Babel to try any of these features.

Let, Const
Template strings
Spread(...) operator
Destructuring assignment
Arrow functions
Ex: map, filtering
Classes
Modules, export, default
