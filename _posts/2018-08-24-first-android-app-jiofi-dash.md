    Almost ready with my first Android app - A dashboard for JioFi 6 (JMR815).
</div>

I always wanted to publish an app in the PlayStore. So, one month back I decided to learn enough of the 
Android framework to be able to develop a simple app. Initially all the ideas I had seemed already exist in the 
PlayStore. Then one fine day, I was having trouble with my JioFi modem, the network speed was low and I had to 
check the status often. Thatâ€™s when I realized I could make an app for this device, as no other app out 
there supports the latest `JioFi 6 (JMR815)` device.

    <strong>Note: </strong>This app only supports JioFi 6(JMR815).
</div>

In all fairness, I did build few apps before. But all of those apps were frankensteined together with the code I found 
on the internet. So this was my first real experience building a complete app. Initially I just wanted something simple 
with basic features like: battery status, connection speed and an option to restart. But later on I came 
up with a list of important features that I thought would be useful.

#### Features

I successfully implemented the following features. Initially it was quite hard since I had to reverse engineer 
the api from the Javascript code of the admin panel provided by JioFi. With some patience and a bit of help from 
Chrome Dev tools, I was able to get information about the api endpoints.

- Battery status
- Battery full and low notification
- Realtime data speeds
- Data usage
- Network band and signal strength
- Devices connected to WiFi
- Block devices on WiFi
- Change WiFi ssid and password
- Restart JioFi
- Enable WPS button
- Open Admin web Ui

#### The UI

I wanted the app to have a simple UI that looked good. So I used `MaterialComponents` from the material design
library. Here are few screenshots:

The app is almost ready to to be published. Please feel free to contact me, if you would like to try the app.
