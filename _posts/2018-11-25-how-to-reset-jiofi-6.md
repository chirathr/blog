Couple of users of my app [`JioFiDash`](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chirathr.jiofidash) reported issues logging into the `WiFi Settings` section of the app. If you are facing login issues try this:

`username:` administrator

`password:` administrator

If this doesn't work, you will need to reset your device.

- Open the backpanel of your JioFi device.
- Inside you will find a pin hole with a label `RESET` next to it.
- Use a small pin or a sim ejector tool to press and hold the reset button for few seconds, till the device restarts.
- Your device will be reset with the default WiFi, password which can be found under the battery.

Then login to the app again with the default username and password: `administrator`.
