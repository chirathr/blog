Couple of users of my app [`JioFiDash`](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chirathr.jiofidash) reported issues logging into the `WiFi Settings` section of the app. If you are facing these issue try this:

username: administrator
password: administrator

If this doesn't work you will need to reset your device.

- Open the backpanel of your JioFi device.
- Inside you will find a pin hole with a label `RESET` next to it.
- Use a small pin or a sim ejector pin to press and hold for few seconds till the device restarts.
- Your device will be reset with the default WiFi, password which can be found under the battery.

Then try loggin into the app again with the default usename and password: `administrator`.

Feel free to leave a comment if you are still facing any issues.
