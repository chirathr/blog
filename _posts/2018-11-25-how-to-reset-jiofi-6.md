Some of the users of my app JioFiDash are having issues logging into the `WiFi Settings` section of the app. If you are 
facing this issue try the default:

username: administrator
password: administrator

If this doesn't work you will need to reset your device.

Open the backpanel of your JioFi device.
Inside you will find a pin hole with a label `RESET` next to it.
Use a small pin or a sim ejector pin to press and hold for few seconds till the device restarts.
Your device will be reset with the default WiFi, password which can be found under the battery.

Then try loggin into the app again with the default usename and password: `administrator`.
