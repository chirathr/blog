### Introduction

JavaScript is the language to learn if you want to build interative webpages that run on the browser. JavaScript is 
one of the most popular languages and it runs pretty much everywhere. It's used for developing desktop application
(ex. Electron), for creating mobile applications(ex. React Native) and can even be found on the server(such as nodeJS).

### Webpack

#### Setup

##### Install NodeJs

Download NodeJs from [https://nodejs.org/en/](https://nodejs.org/en/).

##### Install Git

Most Linux or Mac OS systems should have git by default, if not you can install it using the brew or apt command.

On Mac OS:

```bash
brew install git
```

On a Linux system:

```bash
sudo apt install git
```

##### Clone the web starter pack

Clone or download the [webpack-starter](https://github.com/wbkd/webpack-starter) code.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wbkd/webpack-starter.git
```

Then cd into the directory webpack-starter and run:

```bash
npm install
```

And then to run the development server with auto refresh do:

```bash
npm run start
```

Open up `index.js` to start coding in JS.
